This is a repository containing code for

A directory containing the code we used in our experiments.
The main functions can be found in `a_optimality_funs.jl` and `vertex_cover_funs.jl`.
Other files contain experiments.

A few notes about the code:
1. Our code uses standard Julia libraries, but the dependencies must manually be installed (we haven't provided an install file)
1. Code was written for the Julia Language version 1.0, using earlier versions will throw errors
2. Certain experiments make reference to a `/data` folder, which is not included here due to size limitations. One needs to manually populate the data folder with the publicly available data to reproduce these experiments.
